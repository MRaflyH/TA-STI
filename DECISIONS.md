## D-1 — One installable package, seven fixed subpackages

**Decided.** `code/` holds one package `gfd`, installed with
`pip install -e code/`, with seven subpackages whose names are fixed:
`dataset`, `selection`, `models`, `training`, `evaluation`, `experiments`, plus
a root `config.py`. Module layout inside each subpackage is free. v1's split
into `code/pipeline/src/gfd_data/` and `code/modelling/src/gfd_model/` is not
carried over.

**Why.** Three failures recorded in v1, each traceable to the two-package
layout:

- Commands only ran from `code/pipeline/src/`; from the repo root they raised
  `ModuleNotFoundError`. A `src/` layout with nothing installed contradicts the
  `python3 -m` replay rule it was supposed to satisfy.
- Two `config.py` files owned overlapping truths. The archive records the two
  layers disagreeing about whether `KX` was dropped, and the pipeline config
  citing a modelling decision by the wrong number.
- `experiments.py` fitted, owned the scalers, applied the smearing correction
  and evaluated cross-domain in one file. Both bugs recorded against it were
  coupling bugs across those four jobs.

Separating `models` / `training` / `evaluation` is not justified by those bugs
but by rate of change: the circuit, the optimiser, and the Bab VI tables change
for different reasons, and the tables will change repeatedly during writing.

**Cost.** A `pyproject.toml` and one install step before anything runs. Seven
subpackages is more structure than a one-person project strictly needs, and
`selection/` is being sized before any of it is written.

**Reversal.** Renaming a subpackage is a find-and-replace across `code/` plus
a RUNBOOK edit. Collapsing two subpackages into one is a file move and an
import fix. Neither touches `data/` or any built table. Reverting to the v1
two-package layout would mean re-splitting `config.py`, which is the thing this
decision exists to prevent.

**Bab.** V (Implementasi) carries the layout. III and IV reference `dataset/`
where the data preparation is described.

**Decided by.** Rafly, 2026-09-10.

**Status.** The layout is decided; **none of it is written yet.** No file under
`code/` exists at the time of this entry.
